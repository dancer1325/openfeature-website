- := mechanism /
    - allows
        - adding arbitrary behaviors | flag evaluation life-cycle
          - *Example:* validate a resolved flag value, modify data  | evaluation context, logging, telemetry, tracking
    - can be attached
      - globally == OpenFeature API object — API —
      - at client — Client —
      - at flag invocation level — Invocation — 
    - can implement ≥ 1 flag evaluation lifecycle’s stages

- Flag evaluation life cycle 👁️in order of evaluation 👁️
  - `Before`
    - uses

      - Invocation
  - `After`
    - requirements
      - 👁️flag evaluation has been done successfully 👁️
    - uses
      - validate resolved flag value
      - publish records in other services for
        - telemetry
        - tracking
    - evaluation order
      - Invocation
      - Client

  - `Error`
    - requirements
      - 👁️flag evaluation has been done abnormally 👁️
        - possible reasons
          - flag control plane was NOT reached
          - flag — by flag key — does NOT exist
          - flag’s type — by flag key — ≠ expected type
          - unhandled error during `Before`
    - uses
      - log error messages
      - add records — to a — telemetry provider
    - evaluation order
      - Invocation
      - Client
      - API
  - `Finally` / `finallyAfter`
    - always executed
    - uses
